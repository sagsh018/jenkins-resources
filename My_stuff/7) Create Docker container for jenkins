1) So here in this lecture we are going to spin up the jenkins container using the docker-compose file we have created in 
    previous lecture.
2) Note that on our VM the ownership of our volume folder jenkins_home should be jenkins:jenkins otherwise container will
    not be able to write data on this and we will have errors.
    if you need to correct it run
    # pwd ==> /home/jenkins/jenkins-data
    # sudo chown jenkins:jenkins jenkins_home -R
3) Once we have our docker-compose file ready and all the other conditions are met we are going to bring up the jenkins
    container using below command
    # docker-compose up -d
4) Now once the docker contianer will be up we can see it running using below command
    # docker ps 
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
    934f04fda039        jenkins/jenkins     "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   8 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 50000/tcp   jenkins
    Note that docker is going to bring up this container by reading the docker-compose file.
5) We can check the logs of perticular container running by using below command
    # docker logs -f jenkins
    and this is going to tell that our jenkins container is up and running
    ================================================================================================================
    2020-08-10 08:45:47.560+0000 [id=26]    INFO    jenkins.InitReactorRunner$1#onAttained: Completed initialization
    2020-08-10 08:45:47.611+0000 [id=19]    INFO    hudson.WebAppMain$3#run: Jenkins is fully up and running
    ================================================================================================================
6) Now since we have our jenkins contianer ready we can go ahead and hit our VM ip on port 8080 and which inturn hit 
    our container at the same port 8080 based on the ports mapping we did in docker-compose file.
    jenkin.local:8080
    This is going to give us the welcome screen of jenkins where we are goint to put the pasword for administrator
    
    We are going to get this either from the logs 
    docker logs -f jenkins 
    or as mentioned on the jenkins welcome screen ==> /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    which on our local VM is ==> /home/jenkins/jenkins-data/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ==> ae5fb6cf56f84ceebb103d2c584dae86
    We can put the same and login to jenkins
7) Now we are going to get the customize jenkins screen where we are going to install suggested plugins as of now.
    These plugins add extra funtionalality to our jenkins.
8) once the plugins installation completes then we are going to get the first admin user creation page. We are going to
    create following user
    user name : jenkins
    password : brDSLsd

Now we have to start with Jenkins UI
