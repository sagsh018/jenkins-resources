1) Now since we have downloaded/pulled jenkins image in previous lecture. Now we are going to bring up our jenkins 
    container using that image with the help of docker-compose file.
2) Lets create a folder named as jenkins under our jenkins user home directory
    # pwd
        /home/jenkins
    # mkdir jenkins-data
    # cd jenkins-data
    # pwd   
        /home/jenkins/jenkins-data
3) Now inside this newly created jenkins-data directory we are going to create sample docker-compose file
    # cd jenkins-data
    # vi docker-compose.yml
    =========================
        version: '3'
        services:
            jenkins:
                container_name: jenkins
                image: jenkins/jenkins
                ports:
                    - "8080:8080"
                volumes:
                    - "$PWD/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home"
                networks:
                    - net
        networks:
            net:
    There are couple of things to note here:
    a) We have mentioned services in this docker-compose file and for now we have only one service named as jenkins
    b) We have mentioned container name inside that jenkins service
    c) also we have mentioned image name as well. this image we have already downloaded from docker hub
        and if this wouldn't be available, then docker is going to search this in docker-hub and download and install it.
    d) then we have mentioned our Linux VM host port 8080 exposed for jenkins to run and that is mapped to continer port
        on 80880 as well
    e) Then we have also mentioned columes. that is jenkins_home on our VM is mapped with /var/jenkins_home in coontainer.
    f) Then finally we have created network and added our jenkins service into that network.
