1) Before installing Docker, make sure that your VM is reachable to internet
2) So to install we are going to follow below URL
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/
3) Note that ther are multiple ways of installing Docker, but we are going to install Docker using Repository method
    means we are going to set up the Docker Repo in order to install Docker.
4) for that we have to make sure that our virtual machine is connected to RedHat network from where it has to download 
    the repo packages to install Docker.
5) So lets first register our system on RedHat  
    a) # subscription-manager register --username <username> --password <password> --auto-attach
        This command is going to first register the system to RedHat and then add the subscription as well in one step
        and this is how its going to look in output for above command   
        =============================================================================
        Registering to: subscription.rhsm.redhat.com:443/subscription
        The system has been registered with ID: d2ff8389-4773-4648-8c83-5dd07edf9d84

        Installed Product Current Status:
        Product Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
        Status:       Subscribed
        =============================================================================
6) once the system is registered, lets install Docker on it
    # sudo yum install yum-utils -y
    # sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    # sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms ( This is to avoid errors related to 
        container-selinux)
    # sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    # sudo systemctl start docker
    # sudo systemctl enable docker
7) once this is done, we can check whether docker is installed or not by running below command  
    # docker ps
    Initial this command is going to give below error
    =========================================================================================================
    Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: 
    Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: 
    connect: permission denied
    =========================================================================================================
    To fix this error we can do as below:
    sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
    So basically we are adding jenkins user ID in docker group as secondary. This way jenkins is going to get 
    access to every docker related asset on server.
    once jenkins is added to docker group, do logout and log back in again in order for SHELL variables to be updated
8) Now you can check with below command whether docker us installed or Now
    # docker ps
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
        [jenkins@localhost ~]$
    
In the next video we are going to install docker-compose on VM.
